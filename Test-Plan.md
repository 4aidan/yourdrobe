# YourDrobe Application Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the YourDrobe application. The purpose of this test plan is to provide a comprehensive approach to ensure the quality, reliability, and functionality of both the frontend and backend components of the application. This plan covers the scope of testing, various testing types, high-level test cases, recommended tools, a proposed schedule, and roles and responsibilities for the testing process.

## 2. Scope of Testing

### 2.1. In Scope

The following features and functionalities are in scope for testing:

*   **Frontend (React Application):**
    *   User Authentication (Login/Registration)
    *   Wardrobe View (Displaying, filtering, and searching for clothing items)
    *   Outfit Builder (Creating, editing, and deleting outfits)
    *   Upload View (Adding new clothing items with image uploads)
    *   Analytics View (Displaying wardrobe statistics)
    *   Calendar View (Scheduling and viewing outfits)
    *   Responsive design and cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
*   **Backend (FastAPI Application):**
    *   All RESTful API endpoints as defined in the Backend Development Plan.
    *   CRUD operations for clothing items and outfits.
    *   Data validation and error handling.
    *   Database interactions with MongoDB.
    *   API endpoint for analytics data.

### 2.2. Out of Scope

The following are considered out of scope for the initial testing phase:

*   Third-party integrations (e.g., social media sharing, external analytics services).
*   Performance, load, and stress testing.
*   Formal security vulnerability scanning (beyond basic best practices).
*   Usability and accessibility testing (will be addressed in a separate phase).
*   Testing on mobile operating systems (iOS, Android) beyond responsive web design.

## 3. Testing Types

### 3.1. Unit Testing

*   **Objective:** To test individual components and functions in isolation.
*   **Frontend:** Each React component will have unit tests to verify its rendering and behavior based on props. Utility functions and hooks will also be tested.
*   **Backend:** Each API endpoint's logic, utility functions, and service modules will be tested in isolation. Database interactions will be mocked.

### 3.2. Integration Testing

*   **Objective:** To test the interaction between different components of the application.
*   **Frontend:** Test the integration between multiple components, such as the interaction between the `WardrobeView` and the `UploadView`.
*   **Backend:** Test the integration between different API endpoints and the database. For example, creating an item and then fetching it.

### 3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

*   **Objective:** To test the complete application flow from the user's perspective.
*   **Methodology:** Simulate user workflows such as registering, adding a clothing item, creating an outfit, and viewing analytics. These tests will cover the entire stack from the frontend UI to the backend database.

### 3.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

*   **Objective:** To validate that the application meets the business requirements and is ready for release.
*   **Methodology:** A set of test scenarios will be provided to stakeholders or a focus group to perform. Feedback will be collected and any identified issues will be addressed.

## 4. High-Level Test Cases
